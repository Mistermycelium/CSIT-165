# CSIT-165

Currently this repository only contains a basic `docker-compose.yaml` for setting up RStudio Server with the user `rstudio` and the password `r` for local development use.

To run, execute the command `docker compose up -d` from within the directory, and navigate your browser to `localhost:8787`
